# Working with Stan Rawrysz: A User's Guide 

As we work together, collaboration and communication will be critical to our success.  

For this reason, I’ve created a _Working With Me Guide_ to serve as a template to learn more about each other’s work preferences, personal interests, and what motivates us. 

I welcome you to make a copy and use this as a template to complete for yourself and share with your manager or direct reports. 

Thank you for joining me on this journey. 

## Working Styles 

### What brings me energy at work 

I get a buzz when I'm part of some good collaboration, whether through helping folks in their growth, throughout projects, or in solving problems.  

I believe that if someone has a fulfilling work environment experience through collaboration, autonomy, and mastery, they will naturally do their best work.   

### What drains me at work 

I get drained when I see organizations give up on fixing problems. I love to see folks working on problems, but when more than one person or team is working to fix the same problem without communicating about it, I get a bit disheartened.  

A pet peeve of mine is not following up on follow-up items: not only when folks who have follow-up work don't do it, but also when teams don't follow up on open action items. 

Meetings with no clear agenda, purpose, or action drain me. 

### How I collaborate 

I like having an agenda going into meetings. For one-on-ones, keeping a list of things to talk about in a shared doc, for other meetings, an agenda, and desired outcomes of the meeting. Whenever possible, I prefer to get access to reading material relevant to the meeting ahead of time.  

### Preferred communication channels 
For real-time collaboration, Teams is best. For any important communication blasts, I prefer email. If an in-person meeting or video call would be more efficient for a particular topic, I prefer that. 

### After-hours communication 

I'm not immediately available after east coast business hours, but I make my best effort to respond to urgent messages via Teams or email before lights-out. Otherwise, expect a prompt reply first thing in the morning.  

### A typical day for me looks like... 

I usually wake at 6:30 to get up to 30 minutes to myself in the morning before helping get the kids to school — that includes a slow cup of coffee, some daily word puzzles on my phone, and a start to breakfast, which usually involves eggs.  

My focus block of time is 9-10 AM each work day followed by (usually) meeting-free mornings where I can continue to get focus time or meet with folks east of the Rockies.  

Afternoons are generally booked with meetings and one-on-ones and I try to be offline by 5:30 or 6 to help with dinner and spend time with family.  

Fridays are free of meetings and I like to go to the co-working space at [Bell Works](https://bell.works/new-jersey/explore/) to get out of my 10'x10' box for a day. 

### My expectations of you  

I highly value people who do what they say they will do. I am not a micromanager but I will start zooming in if I feel we are not on track. 

I understand that sometimes it's inevitable that deadlines will be missed, and I expect you to communicate early when you expect to be late. 

### Challenge me when… 

* ...something doesn’t feel right, especially if my actions don’t align to my stated values.
* ...I’m not pushing hard enough. Sometimes I over-index on relationship over task. 

### How I appreciate feedback 

I appreciate direct feedback, especially when you're not getting from me what I've promised in our relationship. 

### My Development: Something I’m working on 

I'm working on holding people more accountable to what they've stated as their goals through direct, actionable feedback. 

While it's been better lately, I struggle with imposter syndrome. 

### My Enneagram / Myers Briggs / DiSC / Strengthsfinder, etc. 

My arrow points solidly in the [S (steadiness)](https://www.discprofile.com/disc-styles/steadiness) category of the DISC assessment.   

"People with S-type personalities are often described as calm, peaceful, or even-tempered. They're dependable and enjoy collaboration.They show a great deal of concern for the feelings of the people around them." 

## Interests 

### Some fun facts about me 

I've recently made a commitment to swim in the ocean at least once every month of the year. After meeting folks in Ireland who a few days a week all year round, I'm tempted to bump that up to once a week. 

I took a break from my software career to become a licensed massage therapist for a few years.  

### My passions outside of work 

I have been doing Aikido since 2004 and have a rank of 4th dan. I love to teach the kids class and enjoy having my kids in the dojo.  

I have been an photography enthusiast for most of my life — since my dad gave me his Minolta XD-11 when I was a teenager. 

### Some pet peeves 

When folks leave the lights on in rooms they're not in or haven't been in for a while. 

### My superpower 

I can move large pieces of furniture by myself.
